Data Structures Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of data structure implementations, primarily in the C programming language. It is designed to provide clear, well-documented examples of common data structures and their operations, making it an excellent resource for both learning and reference.

ðŸ“‚ Languages Covered
C: The main language used for data structure implementations.
Other Languages: To showcase language versatility, additional implementations are provided in Python, Java, C++, and more.
ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside?
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues: Fundamental data structures with various operations and use-cases.
Trees and Graphs: Implementations of binary trees, AVL trees, graphs, and more.
Hash Tables: Explore different hashing techniques and collision resolution methods.
Algorithms: Sorting, searching, and other algorithms tied to data structure manipulation.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Provide a solid foundation in data structure concepts through practical examples.
Offer multi-language support for cross-language comparison and understanding.
Serve as a learning tool for students, educators, and developers alike.
ðŸš€ Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository and explore the folders. Each data structure includes a README file with an explanation of the structure, its use-cases, and instructions on how to compile and run the code.

ðŸ“š Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new data structure, or implementing an existing one in a new language, your input is valued. Please check the contribution guidelines for more details.
